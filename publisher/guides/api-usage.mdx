# How to use the Rest API with authentification

All changes to data using the API require the authentication of the user. In addition, only authenticated users can query non-public data. 
An authorized user must have the right to modify posts to modify or query data. Here, the possibilities for authentication with the Wordpress 
Application Password are presented. Furthermore, it is explained how the API can be tested with Postman and Application Password. 

## WordPress application password

This option is provided directly by WordPress (since version 5.6.). The application password is directly assigned to a user and can not use for an
interactive login. A user can create multiple application passwords. It is recommended to assign a separate application password for each client 
application. If a client application compromise, the user can revoke the password specifically for this application.

### Create an application password

WordPress admins can create Application Passwords for each user, users can also create Application Passwords for their account. Access is through 
the user profile page.

It is important to save the now visible password securely right away. After leaving the page, the password is no longer visible and 
cannot be displayed again. In the list all created Application Passwords are listed and can revoke individually.
